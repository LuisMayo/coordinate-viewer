# CoordinateViewer

This project is a really tiny angular app to show a list of three dimensional coordinates in a 2D-grid. Hovering with your mouse in a cell will tell you al the "z" points found at that x,y for the input data.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --aot` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Contributing
Since this is a tiny project we don't have strict rules about contributions. Just open a Pull Request to fix any of the project issues or any improvement you have percieved on your own. Any contributions which improve or fix the project will be accepted as long as they don't deviate too much from the project objectives. If you have doubts about whether the PR would be accepted or not you can open an issue before coding to ask for my opinion
